# Khaos.Web.Authorization

Role semantics for ASP.NET Core without hand-rolling policies. Khaos.Web.Authorization ships two complementary authorization modes, complete documentation, and a runnable sample so you can harden APIs faster.

## Why Choose Khaos?
- **Two battle-tested modes** – Attribute-based decorators for per-endpoint clarity, plus dynamic middleware for centrally managed rules.
- **Condition-aware** – Plug in custom business predicates (business hours, tenant checks, headers) per rule.
- **NuGet-ready docs** – Specs, developer notes, and user guides are bundled into the package for downstream teams.
- **Scripts + coverage** – PowerShell helpers handle clean/build/test/coverage so CI/CD is trivial.

## Installation

```powershell
dotnet add package KhaosCode.Web.Authorization
```

> Targets .NET 9 (works on .NET 8+). Symbols and docs ship with every release.

## Attribute Mode (Decorators)

Perfect for teams that prefer authorization close to controllers.

```csharp
[RolesAuthorize(RoleRuleKind.AnyOf, new[] { "Admin", "Support" })]
public IActionResult AdminOrSupport() => Ok();

[RolesAuthorize(RoleRuleKind.AnyOf, new[] { "User", "Admin" }, typeof(BusinessHoursCondition))]
public IActionResult BusinessHoursOnly() => Ok();
```

**Benefits**
- Readable by default – each endpoint advertises its access semantics.
- Conditions resolved via DI, so business logic stays testable and reusable.
- Honors ASP.NET Core filters, logging, diagnostics.

**Risks / Things to watch**
- Forgetting to register a condition type returns `403`; add every `IContextAuthorizationCondition` to DI.
- Attribute mode still requires standard authentication (`AddAuthentication`) – anonymous users are auto-denied.

## Dynamic Mode (Rule Store + Middleware)

Ideal when security needs to be data-driven (database/config-driven) or shared across services.

```csharp
var rules = new List<MethodPermissionRule>
{
	new(
		typeFullName: typeof(DynamicDemoController).FullName!,
		methodName: nameof(DynamicDemoController.CreateOrder),
		ruleKind: RoleRuleKind.AllOf,
		roles: new[] { "Admin", "Sales" },
		condition: static (ctx, user, ct) =>
		{
			var headerValue = ctx.Request.Headers["X-Request-Source"].ToString();
			return ValueTask.FromResult(
				string.Equals(headerValue, "Internal", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));
		})
};

builder.Services
	.AddRoleAuthorizationCore()
	.AddDynamicMethodAuthorization(rules);

app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseDynamicMethodAuthorization();
app.UseAuthorization();
```

**Benefits**
- Centralized control – update role requirements without recompiling controllers.
- Multiple rules per action (all must pass) for layered security.
- Works alongside attribute mode; mix and match per endpoint.

**Risks / Things to watch**
- No rule defined? Request is allowed (by design). Cover every sensitive action with explicit rules.
- Conditions run inside the request pipeline; ensure they’re fast and handle cancellation.

## Sample API & Documentation

Clone the repo and run:

```powershell
dotnet run --project src/Khaos.Web.Authorization.Sample/Khaos.Web.Authorization.Sample.csproj
```

Swagger UI demonstrates every semantics combination. The sample also provides JWT issuance endpoints so you can test role combinations quickly.

Documentation lives under `docs/` (also packed into the NuGet package):

- `docs/Specification.md` – full requirements.
- `docs/DeveloperGuide.md` – build/test instructions, scripts, extensibility notes.
- `docs/UserGuide.md` – how to run the sample, issue tokens, and probe endpoints.
- `docs/Versioning.md` – MinVer & release workflow (tags like `Khaos.Web.Authorization/v1.2.0`).

## Build, Test, Coverage

PowerShell helpers keep the workflow consistent on every machine:

```powershell
./scripts/Clean.ps1            # dotnet clean + removes artifacts/TestResults
./scripts/Build.ps1            # restore + build (Release)
./scripts/Test.ps1             # full test suite (unit + integration)
./scripts/Test-Coverage.ps1    # dotnet test --collect + ReportGenerator HTML/Cobertura
```

Coverage artifacts land in `TestResults/coverage`, while NuGet packages drop into `artifacts/packages`.
